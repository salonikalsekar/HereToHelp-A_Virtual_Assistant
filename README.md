# HereToHelp-A_Virtual_Assistant

This is a virtual assistant developed using Python. 

The wikipedia, wx and wolframalpha packages will be used to develop the Virtual Assistant. 
It will help you with the information you desire to have. 

Anything you need, the app will help you with it!

For this, you need to run the file directly and you are good to ask anything to the assistant. 


Thank you.

# HereToHelp-A_Virtual_Assistant

This is a virtual assistant developed using Python. 

The wikipedia, wx and wolframalpha packages will be used to develop the Virtual Assistant. 
It will help you with the information you desire to have.

For the speech recognition we need to install other packages too like espeak and speech_recognition.

Anything you need, the app will help you with it using speech or manually.

For this, you need to install all the packages mentioned above and run the file directly.
You are good to ask anything to the assistant! :)


Thank you.
